Classroom Plugin for DocPad
===========================

This is extremely new and raw in it's setup and thus not intended for any
distribution yet.

It is intended as a very structure learning and help platform for myself to
help me make up my mind on certain software architect choices I am posed with.

First phase it shall hold references to the existing DocPad help documentation
and try to complement this where: - I find the documentation to be missing
(essential) details, information or context - evaluate what type of
documentation method/tool would be appropriate for this - experiment with
source code help documentation generation tools

In next phases I will move more towards a perhaps interactive help and
documentation centre that people can reference and check up on while they are
coding and learning to use: - DocPad - CoffeeScript - Those two above and the
techniques, model and programming paradigms we employ in this context

A perhaps more suitable name would have been in the lines of 'documentation
and help centre' or library. Thats semantics for a later time, because the
idea is still that this would  eventually become a more interactive learning
tool.
