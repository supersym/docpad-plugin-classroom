<p>This is extremely new and raw in it's setup and thus not intended for any
distribution yet.</p>

<p>It is intended as a very structure learning and help platform for myself to
help me make up my mind on certain software architect choices I am posed with.</p>

<p>First phase it shall hold references to the existing DocPad help documentation
and try to complement this where: - I find the documentation to be missing
(essential) details, information or context - evaluate what type of
documentation method/tool would be appropriate for this - experiment with
source code help documentation generation tools</p>

<p>In next phases I will move more towards a perhaps interactive help and
documentation centre that people can reference and check up on while they are
coding and learning to use: - DocPad - CoffeeScript - Those two above and the
techniques, model and programming paradigms we employ in this context</p>

<p>A perhaps more suitable name would have been in the lines of 'documentation
and help centre' or library. Thats semantics for a later time, because the
idea is still that this would  eventually become a more interactive learning
tool.</p>  </td></tr></tbody></table><div id="generated">generated Fri Jan 04 2013 21:38:02 GMT+0100 (CET)  </div><div id="projectname"><a href="./index.html">DocPad Plugin for Learning and Coding</a></div></div></body></html>
